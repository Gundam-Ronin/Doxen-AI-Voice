⭐ PHASE 6 (REVISED): REAL-TIME, FULLY GENERIC HOME-SERVICES OPERATIONS ENGINE

This phase makes Cortana industry-agnostic, plug-and-play, and ready to scale to ANY home service vertical.

Below is the new architecture.

🚀 1. UNIVERSAL FIELD EXTRACTION ENGINE

Instead of extracting plumbing-specific fields, we build a dynamic field model that adapts per business.

Every business profile includes:

Required customer fields

Optional fields

Custom fields

Service categories

Sub-services

Pricing rules

Technician types / job roles

Availability & rules

Example dynamic fields Cortana can capture:
Category	Example Fields
Customer Identity	name, phone, email
Location	address, zip code, access instructions
Service	service category, sub-service, description of issue
Scheduling	preferred date, preferred window, urgency level
Job Details	symptoms, requested equipment, home type
Business-specific fields	permits, warranties, membership plan, prior work

You now have a universal model that works across ANY industry.

Cortana automatically adjusts which fields to ask based on the business account’s stored preferences.

🚀 2. UNIVERSAL INTENT ENGINE

Your intent classifier cannot be “plumbing HVAC electrician.”

It must detect universal home service behaviors, such as:

Primary Universal Intents

Book appointment

Request quote

Ask pricing

Ask availability

Ask about services

Ask about warranty/guarantee

Emergency service

Complaint / issue escalation

Reschedule / cancel

Leave message

Speak to human (fallback)

Sales / new customer

Returning customer

Check technician status

Follow-up request

Membership inquiry

Wrong number / spam

This makes Cortana fully adaptable.

🚀 3. INDUSTRY-AGNOSTIC KNOWLEDGEBASE DESIGN

Each business account can upload:

FAQs

service categories

coverage areas

pricing rules

promotions

scripts

disclaimers

compliance requirements

emergency rules

escalation steps

membership plans

cancellation policies

Cortana pulls context only for that business, keeping everything personalized and safe.

🚀 4. UNIVERSAL APPOINTMENT ENGINE

Instead of “assign a plumber,” the system must assign the correct resource type.

Each business can define:

Service types

Work categories

Durations

Skill matching rules

Regions served

Technician / crew types

Availability windows

Cortana books the right type of resource based on uploaded business rules.

This makes the system work for:

HVAC (technicians)

Roofing (crews)

Solar (inspectors)

Pest Control (operators)

Cleaning (teams)

Landscaping (maintenance teams)

🚀 5. UNIVERSAL DISPATCH LOGIC (MODULAR)

Each business can choose dispatch preference:

Dispatch Modes:

Round-robin

Skill-based

Location-based (zip radius)

Urgency-based

Assign to nearest available

Manual review

Preferred technician first

This makes dispatch logic plug-and-play.

🚀 6. REAL-TIME DATA LOGGING (UNIFIED MODEL)

Every call logs:

Caller identity

All extracted fields

Type of service

Intent confidence

Transcript

Booking outcome

Technician assigned

Email/SMS logs

Follow-up tasks

Call sentiment

Call result

This becomes your universal CRM layer.

🚀 7. BUSINESS-AGNOSTIC AUTOMATIONS

For ANY business type:

Automatic Actions:

✔ email confirmations
✔ SMS confirmations
✔ technician dispatch message
✔ quote request ticket
✔ customer profile creation
✔ appointment creation
✔ lead scoring
✔ follow-up assignment
✔ call summary email to business owner

All generic — all reusable across ANY industry.

🚀 8. REAL-TIME UI UPDATES PER BUSINESS

Your dashboard should adapt dynamically:

Example dynamic panels:

“Service Type: HVAC Inspection”

“Job Category: Electrical Repair”

“Requested Crew: 2-person team”

“Estimated Duration: 1.5 hours”

“Urgency Level: High”

“Customer Membership: Yes/No”

The UI becomes automatically personalized to each business type.

🚀 9. PLUG-AND-PLAY BUSINESS ONBOARDING

To onboard a new company:

Create business profile

Add service categories

Add pricing rules

Add technician types

Add availability

Add coverage area

Add custom fields

Add knowledgebase

Connect calendar

Connect email/SMS

Cortana adapts instantly.

This is what makes you scalable.

🚀 10. ABSOLUTE GOAL OF PHASE 6

Your system becomes:

A universal home-services AI operating system.

Not a “plumbing AI.”
Not an “HVAC AI.”
Not a “technician AI.”

A fully adaptable:

Voice AI appointment setter, dispatcher, sales agent, support assistant, CRM pipeline, analytics engine, and customer-experience platform.
