Phase 6 Buildout, the single most important upgrade of your entire platform.

This will transform Cortana from a “smart voice agent” into a universal, plug-and-play, multi-industry home-services operating system — capable of onboarding ANY business, instantly adapting to their workflow, and executing real-time actions with zero code changes.

Below is the full technical architecture, organized into layers, with everything you need to expand your platform cleanly, professionally, and at scale.

🚀 PHASE 6 BUILDOUT — UNIVERSAL HOME-SERVICES AI OPERATING ENGINE
⭐ SECTION 1 — UNIVERSAL BUSINESS MODEL (THE NEW FOUNDATION)

Every business you onboard must have its own profile, which dynamically rewires Cortana’s behavior.

BusinessProfile Model (Universal)

Each business record contains:

{
  "business_id": "uuid",
  "name": "string",
  "industry": "string | HVAC | Plumbing | Electrical | Cleaning | Pest | etc",
  "service_categories": [
     {
        "name": "string",
        "sub_services": ["list of strings"],
        "required_fields": ["name", "address", "details"],
        "estimated_duration_minutes": 45,
        "urgency_levels_allowed": true
     }
  ],
  "coverage_area": ["zip codes"],
  "business_hours": {
      "monday": ["08:00-17:00"],
      "tuesday": ["08:00-17:00"],
      ...
  },
  "pricing_rules": {
     "flat_rate": false,
     "dynamic_pricing": true,
     "service_specific_rules": {}
  },
  "custom_fields": [
     {"field_name": "Gate Code", "type": "string"},
     {"field_name": "Home Type", "type": "enum", "options": ["Apartment", "House"]}
  ],
  "dispatch_rules": {
     "mode": "skill_based | round_robin | location_based | manual",
     "max_distance_miles": 25
  },
  "technician_types": [
      {"role": "HVAC", "skills": ["AC Repair", "Heater Repair"]},
      {"role": "Handyman", "skills": ["Minor Repair", "Furniture Install"]}
  ],
  "calendar_id": "google_calendar_id",
  "email_template_library_id": "string",
  "knowledgebase_id": "vectorstore_id"
}


This structure makes ANY industry plug-and-play.

You now have a platform like ServiceTitan + Smith.ai + Calendly + GoHighLevel combined.

⭐ SECTION 2 — UNIVERSAL INTENT ENGINE (HOME-SERVICES-WIDE)

Cortana must understand ANY home-services intent:

Primary Call Intents

Book appointment

Request estimate

Ask pricing

Ask about services

Ask availability

Ask about coverage area

Membership plan inquiry

Service emergency

Warranty question

Reschedule / cancel

Technician ETA

Speak to human

Complaint / concern

Wrong number

Meta Intents (system-level)

Provide contact info

Provide address

Provide scheduling preference

Provide job description

Ask follow-up questions

Provide photos/videos (if future MMS support)

The LLM classifies each utterance into intent + confidence.

⭐ SECTION 3 — UNIVERSAL FIELD EXTRACTION ENGINE

Cortana must extract fields with dynamic logic:

Universal fields:

name

phone

email

address

zip code

service category

sub-service

job details

urgency

preferred date/time

alternate date/time

membership status

Industry-specific fields:

Automatically loaded from the business profile.

Example (Cleaning company):

home type

number of bedrooms

square footage

Example (HVAC):

unit age

system type

symptoms

Example (Roofing):

roof age

leak location

Dynamic extraction schema is generated at call start:
{
  "required_fields": ["name", "address", "service_category"],
  "business_custom_fields": ["Gate Code", "Home Type"],
  "service_specific_fields": {
     "HVAC": ["system_type", "symptom_description"],
     "Electrical": ["breaker_type"]
  }
}


Cortana ONLY asks for what’s needed for THAT business.

⭐ SECTION 4 — UNIVERSAL APPOINTMENT ENGINE (ADAPTIVE)

This is the scheduling layer that adapts to ANY service business.

Appointment Fields:

customer info

service category

service sub-type

job duration

urgency

preferred window

assigned technician or crew

special instructions

Appointment Workflows:

real-time availability check

technician skill matching

region matching (zip codes)

rules for emergency vs non-emergency

rescheduling logic

Calendar API supports:

Google Calendar

Outlook (future)

iCal feed export

⭐ SECTION 5 — UNIVERSAL DISPATCH ENGINE

Dispatch logic MUST be industry-agnostic.

Dispatch Modes (configurable per business):

Round Robin

Skill-Based Matching

Location / Radius-Based

Availability Matching

Manual Assignment Mode

Specialist First (ex: electrician must hold license)

Emergency Mode (closest available technician)

Dispatch Outputs:

assigned technician

SMS sent to technician

dashboard updates

dispatch record created

⭐ SECTION 6 — UNIVERSAL KNOWLEDGE ENGINE

Each business connects a knowledgebase:

FAQs

pricing models

service descriptions

warranty rules

membership details

escalation policies

promotions

allowed service areas

appointment rules

Cortana uses vector search to answer ANY question correctly for THAT business.

This keeps it industry-agnostic.

⭐ SECTION 7 — UNIVERSAL CRM AND CALL LOGGING SYSTEM

Every call becomes a lead:

Logged Data:

caller info

extracted fields

intent history

transcript

outcome

booking result

technician assigned

email/SMS status

sentiment score

follow-up tasks

This makes your platform a real CRM alternative.

⭐ SECTION 8 — UNIVERSAL UI ADAPTATION

The dashboard adapts based on industry:

Example:

If the business is HVAC → show “System Type” slots.
If the business is Cleaning → show “Bedrooms” fields.
If the business is Electrical → show “Breaker Panel” fields.

Everything is driven by the BusinessProfile model.

⭐ SECTION 9 — UNIVERSAL EMAIL + SMS AUTOMATION
Email (Mailchimp + SendGrid)

confirmation

reminders

follow-up

review request

marketing drip

SMS (Twilio)

appointment confirmations

technician assignment

work order notifications

emergencies

Every business gets their own templates.
